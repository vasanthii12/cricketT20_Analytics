# cricketT20_Analytics

This project is an in-depth analysis of T20 cricket players using Python, Pandas, Web Scraping, and Power BI. The goal is to analyze player performance and extract insights from various publicly available cricket data sources.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to gather, clean, and analyze player-level performance data from various T20 cricket tournaments. The project includes:

- **Web Scraping**: Scraping player performance data (batting, bowling, etc.) from online sources.
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Cleaning and organizing raw data for further analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Using Python and Pandas for statistical analysis and data visualization.
- **Power BI Dashboard**: Creating an interactive Power BI report to visualize player performance and trends.

## Features

- Collects T20 player data such as runs, wickets, batting and bowling average, strike rate, etc.
- Data analysis using statistical techniques to identify key performance metrics.
- Power BI dashboard to present a user-friendly and interactive view of player stats.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup and Requests for scraping player stats from the web.
- **Power BI**: For interactive data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive data analysis and exploration.
